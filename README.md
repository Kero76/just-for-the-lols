# Just for the lols project

A project with differents things develop just for the lols :D

## Languages

### Text Reverser 

A simple algorithm use to reverse the content of a text.
For example, if you type the following sentence : 
> "Where is Brian ?"

The algorithm return the following result : 
> "? nairB si erehW" 

### Is a Palindrome

A simple algorihme to check if a text send in parameter is a palindrome.  
As a reminder, a palindrom is a word that can be read indifferently from right to left as from left to right.  
For example the string "kayak" can be read from left to right or from right to left.  
Morevoer, the algorithm supports the case sensitive.

## Mathematics 

### Pythagorean Algorithm and his converse

You just enter the 3 size's side and the app return a message to indicate if the triangle is right or not.  
If you type only two side of the 3 possible side, the application compute the third size of the triangle and return the result.

### GCD (Greatest Common divisor)

This algorithm consist it get the greatest common divisor or GCD between two numbers.  
You just enter the first and the second numbers to get the GCD.

## Physics 

### Converters 

A converter to convert volumes, masses and distances into another unit.

### Electricity

A simple page to compute the *voltage*, the *intensity*, the *power* or the *resistance* in function of 2 of these 4 values.
You just type 2 of the 4 value in the field and the app compute instantly the 2 other values.
